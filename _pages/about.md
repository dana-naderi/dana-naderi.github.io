I’m a Master’s graduate in Data Science from Allameh Tabataba’i University in Tehran. My academic background started with a deep dive into mathematics, leading me to discover my passion for data science. Over the past two years, I've dedicated myself to unraveling the mysteries of data, focusing on statistical learning and machine learning with a special interest in Bayesian methods and high-dimensional data analysis.

I've focused not only on studying but also on using my skills to address real issues. I've been involved in projects aimed at diagnosing health conditions and predicting the spread of infectious diseases through data analysis. Beyond my coursework, I've taken on freelance work and made two international contributions, enhancing the field that has influenced my development.
