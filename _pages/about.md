Driven by a profound passion for uncovering the intricacies of data and its profound impact on our understanding and decision-making processes, I am Dana Naderi, a dedicated **Data Scientist** based in Brest, France. My journey in the realm of data science and analytics has been fueled by a relentless pursuit of knowledge, innovation, and application of cutting-edge machine and deep learning technologies to solve complex problems.

My academic background in **Data Science** from Allameh Tabataba'i University, Tehran, Iran, and my foundational degree in **Mathematics** have equipped me with a robust analytical framework, enabling me to excel in high-dimensional data analysis, Bayesian inference, and probabilistic network analysis. I possess over **2 years of experience** in data analysis and management, honed through rigorous academic research and practical projects.

My research interests are diverse, yet focused on leveraging **deep learning, machine learning, statistical learning,** and **probabilistic graphical modeling** to enhance predictive models and algorithms. Notable projects include my work on Bayesian Penalized Regression in High-Dimensional Data Analysis, a testament to my ability to navigate and derive insights from complex datasets, particularly in the context of disease diagnosis using Raman Spectroscopy data.

**Currently**, my exploration into the dynamic Bayesian networks in Brain-Machine Interface showcases my commitment to interdisciplinary research, blending data science with neurological insights to pioneer advancements in human-machine interaction.

As a **post-graduate scholar** and a former high-school **mathematics teacher**, I bring a unique perspective to my work, combining rigorous academic methodology with a practical approach to education and knowledge sharing. My dedication to **open science** is reflected in my active participation in online communities and platforms where I share my findings and collaborate with peers globally.

I am excited to continue my journey, exploring the vast possibilities that data science offers to transform our world, one dataset at a time. Join me in this quest for knowledge and discovery.
