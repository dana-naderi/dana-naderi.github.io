Greetings! I'm a graduate with a Master's degree in Data Science from Allameh Tabatabaâ€™i University, Tehran. My academic path, rooted in mathematics, gradually steered me towards the world of data science. Over the last couple of years, my interest has particularly gravitated towards **statistical learning**, **machine learning**, with a focused curiosity in **Bayesian methods** and the intricacies of **high-dimensional data analysis**.

My experience spans using **Python** and **R** for comprehensive data analysis, and leveraging frameworks like TensorFlow for machine learning projects. I've applied these skills in various projects, contributing to areas such as health diagnostics and epidemiological studies.

Looking ahead, I aim to:
- Deepening my grasp of **learning theories and methodologies**.
- Applying this knowledge to develop advanced, reliable machine learning models.
- Exploring innovative approaches to data analysis and **problem-solving**.

I cherish every opportunity to learn and apply data science, aiming to make a modest impact through diligent study and application.
