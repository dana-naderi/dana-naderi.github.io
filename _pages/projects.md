This project is supported by the **National Elite Foundation of Iran (INEF)**. We work on forecasting changes in the incidence of systemic febrile infectious diseases, specifically COVID-19, based on data gathered from 19 pharmacies in Sanandaj. This is a joint project with [Dr. Abbas Aghaei](link-to-his-google-scholar) from the department of epidemiology at Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, spanning January 2021 - September 2022.

In this work, I am contributing in all parts including problem definition, research design, data analysis and running statistical codes, writing first drafts and editing them. The project is in progress and signifies a collaborative effort to harness pharmacy data for predicting disease epidemics, offering insights into public health management and disease prevention strategies.
